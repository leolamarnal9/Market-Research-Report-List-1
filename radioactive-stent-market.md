<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radioactive Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Retrograde Stents</li><li>Antegrade Stents</li><li>Internal (double-J) Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The radioactive stent market features three primary types: retrograde stents, antegrade stents, and internal (double-J) stents. Retrograde stents are inserted from the bladder upward, assisting in treating ureteral obstructions by directing urine flow. Antegrade stents are placed from the kidney down to the bladder, primarily used for nephrostomy procedures. Internal (double-J) stents consist of a coiled design that ensures ureteral patency and prevents obstruction, commonly used post-surgery or for conditions affecting urine flow. Each type is tailored to specific clinical needs.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Radioactive Stent Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Lithotripsy</li><li>Ureteroscopy</li><li>Ureteroenoscopy</li><li>Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The radioactive stent market encompasses various applications in urology, primarily targeting stone removal procedures. Lithotripsy uses sound waves to fragment kidney stones, while ureteroscopy allows for direct visualization and extraction through the urinary tract. Ureteroenoscopy combines ureteroscopy and endoscopic techniques to address complex obstructions. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy involves a minimally invasive approach for large stone removal. Radioactive stents enhance these procedures by reducing recurrence rates and improving patient outcomes through localized radiation therapy, promoting healing and preventing future obstructions.</p></p>
