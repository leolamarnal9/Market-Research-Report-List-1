<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dredging Services Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydraulic Dredging</li><li>Mechanical Dredging</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dredging services encompass two primary types: hydraulic and mechanical dredging. Hydraulic dredging uses high-pressure water jets to mobilize sediment, which is then suctioned away, making it ideal for deeper water and softer materials. In contrast, mechanical dredging employs excavating equipment like buckets or clamshells to physically remove sediment from the bottom, suitable for shallow waters and harder substrates. Both methods play crucial roles in maintaining waterways, creating channels, and supporting construction and environmental restoration projects.</p></p>
