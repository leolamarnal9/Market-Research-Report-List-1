<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Construction Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastics</li><li>Thermosetting Plastics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The construction plastics market primarily consists of two types: thermoplastics and thermosetting plastics. Thermoplastics are materials that can be repeatedly melted and reformed, making them versatile and easily moldable for various applications, such as pipes and insulation. In contrast, thermosetting plastics undergo a curing process that hardens them permanently, providing enhanced durability and resistance to heat and chemicals, ideal for applications like adhesives and coatings. Both types are essential for improving efficiency and sustainability in construction.</p></p>
